## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
PARTIALLY COMPLETE:

✓ CONTRIBUTING.md updated with dogfood workflow section (line 48-80)
✓ Common workflows documented (manual setup)
✗ docs/reference/dogfood-consistency.md NOT created
✗ Architecture diagrams missing
✗ Troubleshooting guide missing
✗ Code review checklist missing

Recommendation: Rename remaining docs to use dev-setup instead of dogfood.
