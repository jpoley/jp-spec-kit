## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Claude Code commits are missing the required DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) sign-off line. This is a compliance requirement that was ignored in recent PRs (#728, #729, #730).

The DCO sign-off format is:
```
Signed-off-by: Name <email>
```

This needs to be added to:
1. All commits generated by Claude Code
2. Commits created by release.py script
3. Any GitHub Actions workflow commits (if applicable)

The sign-off certifies that the contributor has the right to submit the code under the project's license.

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 All Claude Code commits include Signed-off-by line
- [x] #2 release.py commits include Signed-off-by line
- [x] #3 CI fails if DCO sign-off is missing (add probot/dco or similar check)
- [x] #4 Document DCO requirement in CONTRIBUTING.md or CLAUDE.md
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
## Implementation Complete (2025-12-14)

1. **DCO Documentation** (AC#4): Added DCO section to CONTRIBUTING.md explaining:
   - How to sign commits (`git commit -s`)
   - Format for AI-assisted commits
   - CI enforcement notice

2. **release.py** (AC#2): Added `-s` flag to git commit command

3. **CI Check** (AC#3): Created `.github/workflows/dco-check.yml` that:
   - Checks all PR commits for Signed-off-by line
   - Exempts bot commits (github-actions[bot], dependabot[bot], renovate[bot])
   - Fails with helpful message if sign-off missing

4. **Workflow Updates**: Added `-s` to backlog-archive.yml commit
