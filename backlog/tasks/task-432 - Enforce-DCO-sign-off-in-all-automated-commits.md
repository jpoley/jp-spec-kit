## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Claude Code commits are missing the required DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin) sign-off line. This is a compliance requirement that was ignored in recent PRs (#728, #729, #730).

The DCO sign-off format is:
```
Signed-off-by: Name <email>
```

This needs to be added to:
1. All commits generated by Claude Code
2. Commits created by release.py script
3. Any GitHub Actions workflow commits (if applicable)

The sign-off certifies that the contributor has the right to submit the code under the project's license.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 All Claude Code commits include Signed-off-by line
- [ ] #2 release.py commits include Signed-off-by line
- [ ] #3 CI fails if DCO sign-off is missing (add probot/dco or similar check)
- [ ] #4 Document DCO requirement in CONTRIBUTING.md or CLAUDE.md
