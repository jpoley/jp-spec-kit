<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 AI classifies findings as TP/FP/NI with confidence scores
- [ ] #2 Risk scoring formula: (impact × exploitability) / detection_time
- [ ] #3 Cluster findings by CWE, file, and architectural pattern
- [ ] #4 Generate plain-English explanations (What, Why, How to Exploit, How to Fix)
- [ ] #5 Interactive mode for confirming AI decisions
- [ ] #6 Triage accuracy >85% on benchmark dataset
