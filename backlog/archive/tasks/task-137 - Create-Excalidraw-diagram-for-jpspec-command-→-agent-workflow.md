## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Create a visually polished Excalidraw diagram that provides a rich, interactive visualization of the /jpspec command workflow. This diagram will complement the Mermaid version by offering better visual hierarchy, custom styling, and presentation-ready output. Export both the source .excalidraw file and PNG/SVG renderings.
