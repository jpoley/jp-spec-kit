## Description

Create a polished, production-quality markdown document that explains the /jpspec command orchestration system. This document should serve as the authoritative reference for understanding how the slash commands work, when to use each one, and how the specialized agents collaborate. Embed both the Mermaid and Excalidraw diagrams.
