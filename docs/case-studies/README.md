# JP Spec Kit Case Studies

Real-world usage examples with quantitative metrics and honest assessments.

## Purpose

These case studies document actual projects built using JP Spec Kit's Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow. Each case study includes:

- Project overview and context
- Quantitative metrics (time, quality, rework)
- Developer feedback and quotes
- Honest assessment of challenges
- Lessons learned

## Case Studies

| Case Study | Domain | Metrics | Status |
|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| [Workflow Hook System](01-workflow-hook-system.md) | DevTools | 40% rework reduction | Complete |
| [Constitution Template System](02-constitution-templates.md) | CLI | 35% faster implementation | Complete |
| [Security Scanner Integration](03-security-scanner.md) | Security | 90% test coverage | Complete |

## Key Findings

### Time Savings
- Average 35% reduction in implementation time
- 60% reduction in clarification cycles
- Near-zero rework due to misunderstood requirements

### Quality Improvements
- Average 85% test coverage (vs 60% baseline)
- 70% fewer bugs in production
- Security issues caught during validate phase

### Developer Experience
- Clear acceptance criteria reduce ambiguity
- Workflow phases provide natural checkpoints
- Skills and subagents accelerate specialized work

## Template

Use the [case study template](_template.md) when documenting new case studies.
