| Rank | Repo | Stars | What it is (plain English) |
|---:|---|---:|---|
| 1 | github/spec-kit | 55.1k | The “original” Spec-Driven Development toolkit from GitHub—structured workflow + commands/templates for specs → plans → tasks → execution. |
| 2 | MrLesk/Backlog.md | 4.2k | Markdown-native backlog + kanban-in-a-repo approach, designed for humans + AI agents collaborating inside Git. |
| 3 | wordflowlab/novel-writer | 436 | **Not a generic toolkit**—a spec-kit-inspired novel writing tool. Including it because it’s one of the biggest “spec-kit based” repos by stars. |
| 4 | specpulse/specpulse | 322 | A full SDD framework + CLI with multi-agent / multi-assistant integrations (positions itself as “complete AI-enhanced dev framework”). |
| 5 | Priivacy-ai/spec-kitty | 228 | Spec-driven workflow automation + live kanban dashboard + multi-agent orchestration (more “workflow platform” than just templates). |
| 6 | madebyaris/spec-kit-command-cursor | 90 | Cursor-focused SDD command set (/specify, /plan, /tasks, etc.) to drive a spec→plan→tasks loop inside the IDE. |
| 7 | ibuildwith-ai/cody-pbt | 46 | Opinionated “product builder toolkit” that forces structured docs + planning before implementation (spec-driven guardrails). |
| 8 | MartyBonacci/specswarm | 29 | Claude Code plugin layering SDD + lifecycle commands into a “one plugin” workflow (fork lineage traces back to spec-kit). |
| 9 | sengac/fspec | 21 | Spec-driven system emphasizing Gherkin-style scenarios + test linkage (leans into spec→tests→code traceability). |
| 10 | IBM/iac-spec-kit | 19 | A spec-kit adaptation aimed at Infrastructure-as-Code workflows (requirements → IaC). |
| 11 | davidlee/spec-driver | 10 | Spec-driven framework that treats specs as the “evergreen truth” emitting deltas code must conform to. |
| 12 | chernistry/SDDRush | 0 | Minimal prompt templates + scripts to kickstart SDD (tiny starter kit). |
