  execute this objective (without interaction from me) make your best judgements - track all decisions to .logs/decisions in jsonl format for this branch.. 
use the subagents you need.  track your time.  you have 1 hour (with no human feedback)

do not make this less secure, brittle or complicated.
when i return in 60 minutes i want to see how good you can make this (do not leave this branch) and keep this branch up to date with remote (so interate and log and push remote at key checkpoints) 
leave yourself notes as your contexts gets lower.. so you complete this task ( and leave those notes in a place i can read all) and then refresh your own context.
