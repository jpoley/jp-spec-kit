# Flowspec Case Studies

Real-world usage examples with quantitative metrics and honest assessments.

## Purpose

These case studies document actual projects built using Flowspec's Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflow. Each case study includes:

- Project overview and context
- Quantitative metrics (time, quality, rework)
- Developer feedback and quotes
- Honest assessment of challenges
- Lessons learned

## Case Studies

| Case Study | Domain | Key Outcome | Status |
|------------|--------|-------------|--------|
| [Workflow Hook System](01-workflow-hook-system.md) | DevTools | Significant rework reduction | Complete |
| [Constitution Template System](02-constitution-templates.md) | CLI | Faster implementation | Complete |
| [Security Scanner Integration](03-security-scanner.md) | Security | High test coverage achieved | Complete |

## Key Findings

### Time Savings
- Substantial reduction in implementation time across all projects
- Significantly fewer clarification cycles needed
- Near-zero rework due to misunderstood requirements

### Quality Improvements
- High test coverage achieved consistently
- Fewer bugs reaching production
- Security issues caught during validate phase

### Developer Experience
- Clear acceptance criteria reduce ambiguity
- Workflow phases provide natural checkpoints
- Skills and subagents accelerate specialized work

## Template

Use the [case study template](_template.md) when documenting new case studies.

## Contributing

To add a new case study:
1. Copy `_template.md` to `XX-project-name.md`
2. Fill in all sections with actual metrics
3. Include honest challenges (not just successes)
4. Get developer quotes where possible
5. Submit PR for review
