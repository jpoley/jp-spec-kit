# JP Spec Kit Workflow Configuration
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file defines the state machine for /jpspec command workflows in
# Spec-Driven Development (SDD). It is the authoritative source for:
#
#   - Task states: Valid progression states in the development lifecycle
#   - Workflows: /jpspec slash commands with agent assignments
#   - Transitions: State changes triggered by workflow execution
#   - Agent loops: Inner/outer loop classification for execution model
#
# Configuration Version: 1.0
# Compatible with: jp-spec-kit v0.0.102+

# TASK STATES
# ==============================================================================
# Valid states a task can occupy during the development lifecycle.
# States progress forward via workflows, with manual transitions to "Done".
#
# State Descriptions:
#   - To Do: Initial state - work has not started
#   - Specified: Requirements captured via /jpspec:specify
#   - Researched: Technical and business research completed via /jpspec:research
#   - Planned: Architecture and infrastructure planned via /jpspec:plan
#   - In Implementation: Code actively being written via /jpspec:implement
#   - Validated: QA, security, and documentation validated via /jpspec:validate
#   - Deployed: Released to production via /jpspec:operate
#   - Done: Work complete - ready for archive

states:
  - "To Do"
  - "Specified"
  - "Researched"
  - "Planned"
  - "In Implementation"
  - "Validated"
  - "Deployed"
  - "Done"

# WORKFLOW DEFINITIONS
# ==============================================================================
# Each workflow maps to a /jpspec slash command. Agents are assigned based on
# the actual implementations in .claude/commands/jpspec/*.md

# AGENT LOOP CLASSIFICATION
# ==============================================================================
# Classifies agents by execution model per docs/reference/agent-loop-classification.md
#
# Inner Loop: Fast, local iteration (edit -> run/tests -> debug -> repeat)
#   - Developer velocity and rapid feedback
#   - Pre-commit execution
#   - Code writing, testing, review
#
# Outer Loop: Post-commit CI/CD pipeline
#   - Governance, safety, production reliability
#   - Planning, validation, operations
#   - Build, package, attest, deploy
