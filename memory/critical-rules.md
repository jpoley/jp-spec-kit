# Critical Rules

## No Direct Commits to Main (ABSOLUTE - NO EXCEPTIONS)

**NEVER commit directly to main.** All changes MUST go through a PR:

1. Create branch → 2. Make changes → 3. Create PR → 4. CI passes → 5. Merge → 6. Mark task Done

Not for "urgent" fixes. Not for "small" changes. **NO EXCEPTIONS.**

See `memory/constitution.md` for full details.

## DCO Sign-off (Required)

All commits MUST include sign-off:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat: description"
```

## Version Management

When modifying `src/specify_cli/__init__.py`:
1. Update version in `pyproject.toml`
2. Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Follow semantic versioning

## Backlog.md Task Management

**NEVER edit task files directly** - Use `backlog task edit` CLI commands only.
Direct file editing breaks metadata sync, Git tracking, and relationships.

See: `backlog/CLAUDE.md` for detailed guidance.

## PR-Task Synchronization (Required)

When a PR completes a backlog task, update the task **before or with** PR creation:

```bash
# Mark ACs complete and set status with PR reference
backlog task edit <id> --check-ac 1 --check-ac 2 -s Done \
  --notes $'Completed via PR #<number>\n\nStatus: Pending CI verification'
```

**If PR fails CI**: Revert task to "In Progress" and uncheck incomplete ACs.
The backlog must always reflect reality.

## Git Worktrees for Parallel Work

Worktree name MUST match branch name:

```bash
git worktree add ../feature-auth feature-auth  # Correct
git worktree add ../work1 feature-auth         # Wrong
```
