# Security Scanning Workflow
#
# This workflow calls the reusable security-scan.yml workflow for various triggers:
# - Pull requests
# - Push to main/develop
# - Scheduled nightly scans
# - Manual workflow dispatch
#
# See .github/workflows/security-scan.yml for the reusable workflow implementation.
