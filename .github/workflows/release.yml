# Unified Release Workflow
#
# This workflow handles the ENTIRE release process in a single execution:
# 1. Creates git tag on the merge commit (github.sha)
# 2. Builds packages
# 3. Creates GitHub Release with all artifacts
#
# IMPORTANT: We use github.sha (the merge commit) as the release commit.
# This is ALWAYS valid because it's the commit the workflow is running on.
# We do NOT use .release-commit file because local commit hashes can become
# invalid after rebases/force-pushes.
#
# Triggers:
# - Automatic: When a release/v* PR is merged to main
# - Manual: workflow_dispatch for emergency releases
#
# Security: All GitHub context values are passed via env: blocks to prevent
# script injection attacks. Branch names are validated against strict patterns.
