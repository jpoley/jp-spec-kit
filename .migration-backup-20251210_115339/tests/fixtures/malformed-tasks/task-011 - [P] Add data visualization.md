## Description

[P] Add data visualization

## Phase

Phase 4: User Story 2

## Parallelizable

This task can be worked on in parallel with other parallelizable tasks.

<!--
  THIS IS A NEGATIVE TEST FIXTURE - DO NOT USE AS A TEMPLATE!

  This file demonstrates a malformed task that breaks Backlog.md parsing.

  PROBLEMS:
  1. Filename contains [P] - breaks filesystem and parsing
  2. Title field has unquoted [P] - YAML interprets [ ] as array syntax
  3. The [P] marker from jp-spec-kit should NOT be in Backlog.md titles

  CORRECT APPROACH:
  - Title should be: "Add data visualization" (no [P])
  - Add "parallelizable" as a label instead
  - Filename should be: "task-011 - Add data visualization.md"
