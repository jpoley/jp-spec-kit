# Feature: Data Processing

## Description

We need to process data from various sources and store it in the database. The system should handle different file types and maybe validate the data before storing.

## User Story

As a user I want to upload files so that the system can process them.

## Some Requirements

- Process files
- Validate data etc
- Store in database
- Send notifications possibly

## Implementation

TBD - need to figure out which database to use. The implementation will be simple and basically just read files and save them. We should probably add some error handling too.

TODO: Add validation rules
TODO: Define file format support

??? What about large files?
