create a catalog of stacks implementations & per language coding standards to choose from 

also needs to work with a project level stack definition and coding standards for languages used.
https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os

refer to the languages in .languages folder (if there is a match)

# Languages:  
    - Go - backend, API & CLI, K8s Operators, etc
    - Typescript - front end (react) and backend bun + typescript
    - Python - backend + Data / ML Pipelines
    - Swift / React Native / Kotlin - Mobile

Stacks are chosen in /jpspec.plan by combination of
- agent project architect
- agent platform engineer

they should be in a .stacks folder and also there will need to be criteria as to which stack is chosen based on requirements.  (these stacks will improve and evolve over time)

# Stacks:
    - Full Stack React
    - React Frontend - Go Backend
    - Mobile Frontend - Go Backend
    - React Frontend - Python Backend
    - Mobile Frontend - Python Backend
    - Data / ML Pipeline - Python
    - VS Code extension - typescript full stack
    - Chrome plugin - typescript full stack
    - Tray App (Windows) - 
    - Tray App (Mac) -
