# /jpspec:validate - Enhanced Phased Validation Workflow

Execute comprehensive validation workflow with task orchestration, automated testing, agent validation, AC verification, and PR generation.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

**Expected Input**: Optional task ID (e.g., `task-094`). If not provided, command discovers the current in-progress task automatically.

{{INCLUDE:.claude/commands/jpspec/_workflow-state.md}}

**For /jpspec:validate**: Required input state is `workflow:In Implementation`. Output state will be `workflow:Validated`.

If the task doesn't have the required workflow state, inform the user:
- If task needs implementation first: suggest running `/jpspec:implement`
- If validation is being re-run on deployed work: use `--skip-state-check` if appropriate

**Proceed to Phase 0 ONLY if workflow validation passes.**

## Workflow Overview

This command orchestrates a phased validation workflow:

- **Phase 0: Task Discovery & Load** - Find/load target task
- **Phase 1: Automated Testing** - Run tests, linting, type checks
- **Phase 2: Agent Validation (Parallel)** - QA Guardian + Security Engineer
- **Phase 3: Documentation** - Technical Writer agent
- **Phase 4: AC Verification** - Verify all acceptance criteria
- **Phase 5: Task Completion** - Generate notes and mark Done
- **Phase 6: PR Generation** - Create pull request with approval

## Execution Instructions

Follow these phases sequentially. **Phase failures MUST halt the workflow** with clear error messages indicating which phase failed and why.

The command is **re-runnable** after fixing issues - it handles partial completion gracefully by checking task state at each phase.

---

### Phase 0: Task Discovery & Load

**Report progress**: Print "Phase 0: Discovering and loading task..."

#### Step 1: Determine Target Task ID

```bash
# If user provided task-id argument, use it
TASK_ID="$ARGUMENTS"

# Otherwise, discover in-progress task
if [ -z "$TASK_ID" ]; then
  # Find tasks in "In Progress" status
  backlog task list -s "In Progress" --plain
fi
```

**Task Selection Logic**:
- If user provided task ID: Use it directly
- If no argument: Find the single "In Progress" task
- If multiple "In Progress" tasks: Ask user which one to validate
- If no "In Progress" tasks: Error and halt

**Error Handling**:
- If task ID not found: "❌ Phase 0 Failed: Task {task-id} does not exist."
- If no in-progress tasks: "❌ Phase 0 Failed: No tasks in 'In Progress' status. Please specify a task ID."
- If multiple in-progress tasks: List them and ask user to specify which one

#### Step 2: Load Full Task Details

```bash
# Load complete task data
backlog task <task-id> --plain
```

**Parse critical fields**:
- Task ID
- Title
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria (list with checked status)
- Current Status
- Implementation Plan (if exists)
- Implementation Notes (if exists)

**Phase 0 Success**: Print task summary:
```
✅ Phase 0 Complete: Loaded task-094
   Title: Integration - Enhanced /jpspec:validate Command
   Status: In Progress
   ACs: 0/8 complete
```

---

### Phase 1: Automated Testing

**Report progress**: Print "Phase 1: Running automated tests, linting, and type checks..."

**Important**: Only run tests if code changes are involved. Skip for documentation-only tasks.

#### Step 1: Detect Project Type

```bash
# Check for test frameworks
if [ -f "pyproject.toml" ]; then
  # Python project
  echo "Detected Python project"
elif [ -f "package.json" ]; then
  # Node.js project
  echo "Detected Node.js project"
fi
```

#### Step 2: Run Test Suite

**For Python projects**:
```bash
# Run pytest with coverage
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src/specify_cli --cov-report=term-missing

# Run linting
ruff check . --output-format=concise

# Run type checks (if mypy configured)
if [ -f "pyproject.toml" ] && grep -q "mypy" pyproject.toml; then
  mypy src/
fi
```

**For Node.js projects**:
```bash
# Run tests
npm test  # or bun test, pnpm test

# Run linting
npm run lint  # or eslint .

# Run type checks
npm run typecheck  # or tsc --noEmit
```

#### Step 3: Evaluate Results

**Success criteria**:
- All tests pass (exit code 0)
- No critical linting errors
- Type checks pass (if applicable)

**Error Handling**:
- If tests fail: "❌ Phase 1 Failed: {N} test(s) failed. Fix tests before continuing."
- If linting fails: "⚠️  Phase 1 Warning: Linting issues detected. Review before continuing."
- If type checks fail: "❌ Phase 1 Failed: Type check errors found."

**Phase 1 Success**: Print test summary:
```
✅ Phase 1 Complete: All automated checks passed
   Tests: 45 passed
   Coverage: 87%
   Linting: No issues
   Type checks: Passed
```

**Re-run handling**: If tests already passed in previous run, skip and print:
```
⏭️  Phase 1 Skipped: Tests already validated in previous run
```

---

### Phase 2: Agent Validation (Parallel Execution)

**Report progress**: Print "Phase 2: Launching QA Guardian and Security Engineer agents (parallel)..."

**IMPORTANT**: Launch QA and Security agents in parallel for efficiency using the Task tool.

#### Backlog Instructions Template

Each validator agent context below includes `{{BACKLOG_INSTRUCTIONS}}` which must be replaced with the content from `.claude/commands/jpspec/_backlog-instructions.md`. This ensures all agents have consistent backlog task management instructions.

**When executing this command, include the full content of `_backlog-instructions.md` in place of each `{{BACKLOG_INSTRUCTIONS}}` marker.**

#### Agent 1: Quality Guardian (QA Testing)

Use the Task tool to launch a **general-purpose** agent (Quality Guardian context):

```
# AGENT CONTEXT: Quality Guardian

You are the Quality Guardian, a vigilant protector of system integrity, user trust, and organizational reputation. You are the constructive skeptic who sees failure modes others miss, anticipates edge cases others ignore, and champions excellence as the minimum acceptable standard.

## Core Philosophy
- **Constructive Skepticism**: Question everything with intent to improve
- **Risk Intelligence**: See potential failures as opportunities for resilience
- **User-Centric**: Champion end user experience above all else
- **Long-Term Thinking**: Consider maintenance, evolution, technical debt from day one
- **Security-First**: Every feature is a potential vulnerability until proven otherwise

## Analysis Framework
1. **Failure Imagination Exercise**: List failure modes, assess impact/likelihood, plan detection/recovery
2. **Edge Case Exploration**: Test at zero, infinity, malformed input, extreme load, hostile users
3. **Three-Layer Critique**: Acknowledge value → Identify risk → Suggest mitigation
4. **Risk Classification**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

## Risk Dimensions

{{BACKLOG_INSTRUCTIONS}}
- Technical: Scalability, performance, reliability, concurrency
- Security: Vulnerabilities, attack surfaces, data exposure
- Business: Cost overruns, market timing, operational complexity
- User: Usability issues, adoption barriers, accessibility
- Operational: Maintenance burden, monitoring, debugging

```

#### Agent 2: Security Engineer

Use the Task tool to launch a **general-purpose** agent (Secure-by-Design Engineer context):

```
# AGENT CONTEXT: Secure-by-Design Engineer

You are a Secure-by-Design Engineer, an experienced security specialist focused on building security into the development lifecycle from the ground up. Security is not a feature to be added later, but a fundamental quality built into every aspect of the system from the beginning.

## Core Principles
- **Assume Breach**: Design as if systems will be compromised
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access
- **Fail Securely**: Failures don't compromise security
- **Security by Default**: Secure out of the box

## Security Analysis Process
1. **Risk Assessment**: Identify assets, threats, business impact
2. **Threat Modeling**: Assets, threats, attack vectors
3. **Architecture Analysis**: Security weaknesses in design
4. **Code Review**: Vulnerability patterns (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
5. **Access Control Review**: Authentication, authorization, privilege management
6. **Data Flow Analysis**: Sensitive information handling
7. **Dependency Security**: Third-party vulnerabilities
8. **Incident Response**: Monitoring and detection capabilities

## Severity Classification
- **Critical**: Authentication bypass, SQL injection, RCE
- **High**: XSS, privilege escalation, data exposure
- **Medium**: Information disclosure, DoS, weak crypto
- **Low**: Config issues, missing headers

- Ready for publication
```

**Phase 3 Success**: Print summary:
```
✅ Phase 3 Complete: Documentation updated
   Files updated: 3
   Sections added: User Guide, API Reference
```

---

### Phase 4: Acceptance Criteria Verification

**Report progress**: Print "Phase 4: Verifying acceptance criteria completion..."

This phase systematically verifies all task acceptance criteria are met.

#### Step 1: Load Current Task State

```bash
# Reload task to get latest AC status
backlog task <task-id> --plain
```

#### Step 2: Parse Acceptance Criteria

Extract the list of acceptance criteria with their checked status:
```json
{
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    {"text": "Command accepts optional task-id argument", "checked": false},
    {"text": "Executes phases in order", "checked": false},
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### Step 3: Verify Each AC

For each unchecked acceptance criterion:

**Automated ACs** (can be verified by test results):
- Check if corresponding tests passed in Phase 1
- If tests passed, mark AC complete: `backlog task edit <task-id> --check-ac N`

**Manual ACs** (require human verification):
- Present AC to user
- Show relevant evidence (test output, code changes, agent reports)
- Ask user: "Has this acceptance criterion been met? [y/N]"
- If yes, mark complete: `backlog task edit <task-id> --check-ac N`
- If no, halt and report which AC failed

#### Step 4: Verify 100% Completion

After verification loop:
```bash
# Reload task to confirm all ACs checked
backlog task <task-id> --plain
```

**Success criteria**: All ACs must have `"checked": true`

**Error Handling**:
- If any AC unchecked: "❌ Phase 4 Failed: {N} acceptance criteria not yet verified. Cannot proceed to completion."
- List unchecked ACs by index and text

**Phase 4 Success**: Print summary:
```
✅ Phase 4 Complete: All acceptance criteria verified
   Total ACs: 8
   Verified: 8
   Status: 100% complete
```

---

### Phase 5: Task Completion

**Report progress**: Print "Phase 5: Generating implementation notes and marking task complete..."

#### Step 1: Generate Implementation Summary

Create comprehensive implementation notes based on:
- What was implemented (from task description and changes)
- How it was tested (from Phase 1 test results)
- Key decisions made (from agent reports)
- Validation results (from Phases 2-3)

**Example implementation notes format**:
```markdown
## Implementation Summary (2025-12-01 15:30:00)

### What Was Implemented
Enhanced the /jpspec:validate command with phased orchestration workflow.
Implemented 7 distinct phases with progress reporting and error handling.

### Testing
- All unit tests passing (45/45)
- Integration tests passing (12/12)
- Linting: No issues
- Type checks: Passed

### Key Decisions
- Used TaskCompletionHandler pattern for AC verification
- Implemented re-runnable workflow with state checks
- Added progress reporting at each phase
- Parallel agent execution in Phase 2 for efficiency

### Validation Results
- QA Guardian: 15 scenarios validated, all passed
- Security Engineer: No critical vulnerabilities
- Documentation: Updated 2 command files
```

#### Step 2: Add Implementation Notes

```bash
backlog task edit <task-id> --notes $'<implementation-summary>'
```

#### Step 3: Mark Task as Done

**Important**: Only mark Done if task status is currently "In Progress"

```bash
# Check current status first
backlog task <task-id> --plain

# If status is "In Progress", mark Done
if [ "$status" == "In Progress" ]; then
  backlog task edit <task-id> -s Done
fi
```

**Re-run handling**: If task already "Done", skip this step:
```
⏭️  Phase 5 Skipped: Task already marked Done
```

**Phase 5 Success**: Print summary:
```
✅ Phase 5 Complete: Task marked as Done
   Task ID: task-094
   Final Status: Done
   Implementation notes: Added
```

---

### Phase 6: Pull Request Generation

**Report progress**: Print "Phase 6: Generating pull request with human approval..."

This phase creates a well-formatted pull request using the PRGenerator pattern.

#### Step 0: Pre-PR Validation Gate (MANDATORY - NO EXCEPTIONS)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Before creating any PR, ALL validation checks MUST pass.**

This is a blocking gate. Do NOT proceed to PR creation until ALL checks pass.

```bash
# 1. Run lint check - MUST pass with ZERO errors
uv run ruff check .

# 2. Run test suite - MUST pass with ZERO failures
uv run pytest tests/ -x -q

# 3. Check for unused imports/variables
uv run ruff check --select F401,F841 .
```

**Validation Checklist (ALL REQUIRED)**:

- [ ] `ruff check .` passes with zero errors
- [ ] `pytest tests/ -x -q` passes with zero failures
- [ ] No unused imports (`ruff check --select F401`)
- [ ] No unused variables (`ruff check --select F841`)
- [ ] Code is formatted (`ruff format .`)

**If ANY check fails**:
```
❌ Pre-PR Gate Failed: Validation checks must pass before PR creation.

Failures:
- [List failed checks]

Fix all issues and re-run /jpspec:validate
```

**⚠️ DO NOT proceed to Step 1 if ANY validation check fails.**

PRs that fail CI:
- Waste reviewer time
- Create noise in the repository
- Demonstrate lack of due diligence
- Will be closed without review

#### Step 1: Check Branch Status

```bash
# Verify current branch is pushed to remote
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u} 2>/dev/null
```

**If branch not pushed**:
```
⚠️  Warning: Current branch is not pushed to remote.
Please push your branch first:
  git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)

❌ Phase 6 Failed: Branch not pushed to remote
```

Halt and wait for user to push branch.

#### Step 2: Generate PR Title

Use conventional commit format derived from task title:
```
# Task title: "Integration - Enhanced /jpspec:validate Command"
# PR title: "feat: enhanced /jpspec:validate command"
```

**PR Type Detection**:
- If task has label "feature": `feat:`
- If task has label "fix" or "bug": `fix:`
- If task has label "docs": `docs:`
- If task has label "refactor": `refactor:`
- Default: `feat:`

#### Step 3: Generate PR Body

Create comprehensive PR body with sections:

```markdown
## Summary
Completes task: task-094

[Implementation notes from Phase 5]

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [x] Command accepts optional task-id argument; defaults to current in-progress task if not provided
2. [x] Executes phases in order: 0 (load) → 1 (test) → 2 (agents, parallel) → 3 (docs) → 4 (verify) → 5 (complete) → 6 (PR)
3. [x] Each phase reports progress to user before execution
4. [x] Phase failures halt workflow with clear error message
5. [x] Command can be re-run after fixing issues
6. [x] Updates .claude/commands/jpspec/validate.md
7. [x] Updates templates/commands/jpspec/validate.md
8. [x] Includes comprehensive help text

## Test Plan

- ✅ Unit tests: 45 passed
- ✅ Integration tests: 12 passed
- ✅ Linting: No issues
- ✅ Type checks: Passed
- ✅ Manual testing: Validated all phases execute correctly

## Validation Results

- **QA Guardian**: 15 scenarios validated, all passed
- **Security Engineer**: No critical vulnerabilities found
- **Documentation**: Command files updated and validated
```

#### Step 4: Present PR Preview

Display formatted PR preview to user:
```
================================================================================
PR PREVIEW
================================================================================

Title: feat: enhanced /jpspec:validate command

Body:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Full PR body as shown above]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

#### Step 5: Request Human Approval

**Critical**: Must get explicit approval before creating PR.

```
Create this pull request? [y/N]:
```

- If user enters `y` or `yes`: Proceed to Step 6
- If user enters anything else: Cancel PR creation

**If cancelled**:
```
❌ Phase 6 Cancelled: PR creation cancelled by user

Next steps:
- Review PR preview above
- Make any needed changes
- Re-run /jpspec:validate to try again
```

Exit gracefully without error.

#### Step 6: Create PR Using gh CLI

```bash
gh pr create --title "<pr-title>" --body "<pr-body>"
```

**Error Handling**:
- If `gh` not found: "❌ Phase 6 Failed: GitHub CLI not installed. Install from https://cli.github.com/"
- If `gh pr create` fails: Display gh error message and halt
- If PR already exists for branch: Display existing PR URL

#### Step 7: Extract PR URL

Parse PR URL from `gh` output and display to user.

**Phase 6 Success**: Print summary:
```
✅ Phase 6 Complete: Pull request created successfully

PR URL: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
Task: task-094 (Done)

Workflow complete! 🎉
```

3. Merge PR once approved and all checks pass
4. Delete feature branch after merge
================================================================================
```

---

## Error Recovery

If any phase fails, the workflow halts with a clear error message. To recover:

1. **Review the error message** - Identifies which phase failed and why
2. **Fix the issue** - Address the root cause (failing tests, unchecked ACs, etc.)
3. **Re-run the command** - Execute `/jpspec:validate <task-id>` again
4. **Resume from where it left off** - Workflow is idempotent and handles partial completion

**Example error recovery**:
```bash
# Phase 1 failed due to test failures
❌ Phase 1 Failed: 3 test(s) failed. Fix tests before continuing.

# Developer fixes tests
# Re-run validate command
/jpspec:validate task-094

# Workflow detects tests now pass and continues from Phase 2
```

---
