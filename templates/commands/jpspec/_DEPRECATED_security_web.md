# DEPRECATED: This command has moved

This command has been **deprecated** and will be removed on **2026-12-09**.

## New Command

Please use the new role-based command instead:

```bash
/sec:scan [arguments]
```

## Why the Change?

Specflow has migrated to role-based command namespaces to improve discoverability and align commands with team roles. The `/jpspec` namespace contained 18+ commands, making it difficult to find relevant commands.

## Migration

Simply replace `/jpspec:security_web` with `/sec:scan` in your workflows. The functionality is identical.

**Before**:
```bash
/jpspec:security_web my-feature
```

**After**:
```bash
/sec:scan my-feature
```

## Role-Based Command Structure

Commands are now organized by role:

- `/pm` - Product Manager commands (assess, define, discover)
- `/arch` - Architect commands (design, decide, model)
- `/dev` - Developer commands (build, debug, refactor, cleanup)
- `/sec` - Security Engineer commands (scan, triage, fix, audit, report)
- `/qa` - QA Engineer commands (test, verify, review)
- `/ops` - SRE/DevOps commands (deploy, monitor, respond, scale)
